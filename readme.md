# Photo Filter Practice
This is created as a practice resource for Base Camp students practicing python.\
With this, there can be good practice with list comprehension and higher order functions

### What needs to be done
In the ``change_image`` function in ``photo_filter.py`` you will create a new list of rgb values to create your own photo filter.\
I will do an example for the whole class before beginning.\
Once you are comfortable converting RGB values in a ``for`` loop, try it with list comprehension, and then a ``map`` function.

### Dependences
ATTN BASE CAMP STUDENTS\
This application uses the python image libarary (PIL or pillow), to use it you will need to install pillow.\
Run this code in the terminal to install pillow.
```
$ pip3 install pillow
```
